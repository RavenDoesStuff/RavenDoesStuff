Ever since I joined GitHub **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago, I pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects, and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

I mostly write **Rust** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **C**, **Go**, **Python**, **JS**) that are worth mentioning:

- [CoolModFiles](https://github.com/orhun/CoolModFiles) - A web player that plays some cool MOD files randomly
- [kermit](https://github.com/orhun/kermit) - A VTE-based, simple and froggy terminal emulator
- [zps](https://github.com/orhun/zps) - A small utility for listing and reaping zombie processes
- [pkgtop](https://github.com/orhun/pkgtop) - Interactive package manager and resource monitor
- [grapheneX](https://github.com/grapheneX/grapheneX) - Automated system hardening framework
- [Picasso](https://github.com/orhun/Picasso) - PIC16F877A based 5V/20MHz development board and PIC programmer
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/orhun/dotfiles) - `/home/orhun/`

I [maintain](https://archlinux.org/packages/?maintainer=orhun) a handful of packages for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), including some popular **Rust** software. I also contribute to [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) and various other open source projects through this voluntary work.

I sometimes write [blog](https://blog.orhun.dev) posts and occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/orhunp_) about stuff. Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orhunp/) about **job-related** matters.
